# Base converter tool

This is a simple tool to convert between the most popular bases (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal). You can copy the converted number for other uses.

## How to set it up

Install this dependency:

```bash
npm install @sihuaguofen/base-converter
```

And then run the build:

```bash
npm run build
```
